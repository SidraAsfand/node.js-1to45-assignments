// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

  function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(name=>console.log(name));
  }
  
  function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
    return magicians.map(name=> `THE GREAT ${name}`);
    }
  const magicians_name: string[] = ['Naeem', 'Hussain', 'Faheem', 'Shahmeer', 'Shehzad', 'Irfan'];
 let great_magicians= make_great(magicians_name);
  show_magicians(great_magicians);
